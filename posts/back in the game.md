# back in the game

3 years ago I started developing some basic games for gamejams, with the hope of getting started in gamedev, learning some code and having fun in my free time. Far from a hit, my games are an attempt to improve myself to do my best. I don't make money (yet) from them; but I will try to do it in the nearer future.

## some games I develop (as INDDDx)

- [an unpunctual thief](https://indddx.itch.io/an-unpunctual-thief) - A game about a guy with a time problem.

- [INFLUENCE: Awakening](https://indddx.itch.io/influence-awakening) - Retro action shooter inspired by the aesthetics of retro FPS titles.

- [flowerup](https://indddx.itch.io/flowerup) - An idle game inspired in Tamagotchi games and stuff like that.
