# upcoming projects

Hi! In a couple of weeks I will made some prototypes and MVPs for test concepts. One of them is a remake of my first game [an unpunctual thief](https://indddx.itch.io/an-unpunctual-thief) but now in 3D. It's a simple platformer inspired in Super Mario 64 and Fall Guys but just an arcade  style game with collectables and power-ups. In a future, I try to develop a multiplayer mode (maybe local).

The second game I will working is a short narrative 3D puzzle (name TBA).

That is all for now. Thanks for reading, following and share this with others.
